# Figure Drawing Tool

## Using the Spec Files
I use pyinstaller to compile the apps. Unfortunately, in order to compile per OS you actually need to be on that os (a Virtual Box works just fine).

### With the spec files all you need to do is run:

"pyinstaller figure_drawing_tool_win.spec"
OR
"pyinstaller figure_drawing_tool_osx.spec"

This'll build a build environment and compile the tool into an executable or an app. The resulted file is in the dist directory.
